<h2 id="how">How this works</h2>
<p>tldr: machine learning detects screens in images</p>
<p>In the backend every 10 seconds a bot takes a screenshot of the stream an analyzes it if it can detect a jump king screen in it. If it detects one it gets added to the data points, otherwise the screenshot is ignored.</p>
<h3>The machine learning</h3>
<p>I took a speedrun of jump king and extracted about 5 seconds for each screen. From this I extracted the frames for further processing.<p>
<p>To reduce the complexity the images are resized to 40x22 pixels and the edges are detected. This reduces the information of each image from 1920*1080*255*255*255 = 34383139200000 (pixels * rgb information) to 40*22*2 = 1760 (pixels * black or white).</p>
<p>Below are examples of what the machine learning models sees.</p>
<p>Screen 20</p>
<img src="images/screen20/1.jpg" alt="jump king screen 20">
<img src="images/screen20/2.jpg" alt="jump king screen 20">
<img src="images/screen20/3.jpg" alt="jump king screen 20">
<p>Screen 11</p>
<img src="images/screen11/1.jpg" alt="jump king screen 11">
<img src="images/screen11/2.jpg" alt="jump king screen 11">
<img src="images/screen11/3.jpg" alt="jump king screen 11">
<p>As you can see there are clear differences between different screens. These differences can also be detected by machine learning models.</p>
<p>Actually I am using 5 different machine learning models. There is often other stuff on screen which is obviously not included in the learning data from the speedrun. I noticed when using a single model that it would get confused and miss classify images despite having over 99% accuracy on frames from the speedrun. So I just use 5 models and let them each classify images independently. If 4 or more agree on a screen then that probably true.<p>
<p>The rest is just applying the preductions to the streams and plotting the results.</p>
